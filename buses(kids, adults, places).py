# Description:
# To get to the health camp, the organizers decided to order buses.
# It is known that some children kids and adults adults are going to go to the camp.
# Each bus has a certain number of seats places. There must be at least two adults on each bus in which children will travel.
# Determine whether it will be possible to send all children and adults to the camp,
# and if so, what is the minimum number of buses required to order for this.
# Input data:
# arguments kids, adults, places each of them does not exceed 10,000.
# Output data:
# We need to return the number of buses that need to be ordered. If it is impossible to send everyone to the camp, return 0
# kids=10, adults=4, places=7 --> 2 (2 buses, both seating 2 adults & 5 kids)
# kids=10, adults=4, places=5 --> 0 (impossible to send everyone to the camp)
